# Enhancing Lumbar Vertebrae Detection Using Neighboring Spatial Relationships in X-ray Images
we propose a novel approach to enhance vertebrae detection accuracy by exploiting both global and local spatial relationships between neighboring vertebrae. 

Visual results for this code: (a) represents the ground truth for object detection, while (c) compared to (b), incorporates the learning and utilization of neighboring vertebra local spatial information during both training and inference stages.

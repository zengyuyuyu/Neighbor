# Enhancing Lumbar Vertebrae Detection Using Neighboring Spatial Relationships in X-ray Images
We propose a novel approach to enhance vertebrae detection accuracy by exploiting both global and local spatial relationships between neighboring vertebrae. 

We conduct extensive experiments on two lumbar spine datasets.
1. CM Spine Dataset. We use a mobile dual-mode G-arm X-ray machine (Geelin500-A) to collect 208 1024 * 1024 lumbar spine X-ray anterior view images during surgical procedures. (Available at: https://services.informatics.buu.ac.th/spine/.)
2. BUU Spine Dataset. The Burapha Spine Dataset version 0.1 is a publicly available dataset of lumbar spine X-ray images. (Available at: https://services.informatics.buu.ac.th/spine/.)

Visual results for this code: (a) represents the ground truth for object detection, while (c) compared to (b), incorporates the learning and utilization of neighboring vertebra local spatial information during both training and inference stages.
